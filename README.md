<p align="left">Vectors are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes the array may need to be extended. Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.</p>
## FINDING BUGS :
Finding bugs is a huge part of a programmer‚Äôs life. Don‚Äôt be intimidated by them‚Ä¶ embrace them. Errors in your code mean you‚Äôre trying to do something cool!

> In this lesson, we have learned about the four types of C++ errors :

  Compile-time errors: Errors found by the compiler.
  
  Link-time errors: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
  
  Run-time errors: Errors found by checks in a running program.
  
  Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.
  
  Remember, Google and Stack Overflow are a programmer‚Äôs best friends. For some more motivation, check out this blog post: Thinking About Errors in Your Code   Differently.

Vectors are a sequence of elements that you can access by an index.

std::vector<int> even = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
The first index in a vector is 0.

Some of the functions that come with vectors:

>push_back()
>pop_back()
>size()

We can use a for loop to iterate through a vector.
