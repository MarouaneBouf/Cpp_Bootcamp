## FINDING BUGS :
Finding bugs is a huge part of a programmer’s life. Don’t be intimidated by them… embrace them. Errors in your code mean you’re trying to do something cool!

> In this lesson, we have learned about the four types of C++ errors :

  Compile-time errors: Errors found by the compiler.
  
  Link-time errors: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
  
  Run-time errors: Errors found by checks in a running program.
  
  Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.
  
  Remember, Google and Stack Overflow are a programmer’s best friends. For some more motivation, check out this blog post: Thinking About Errors in Your Code   Differently.
